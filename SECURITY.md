- Providing you with an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
- Notifying you when the vulnerability has been fixed.
- Giving you credit for your discovery, if you wish.

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Scope
